        <h1>How to Play Battleship</h1>

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>Battleship is a strategy game played between two players. The goal is to sink your opponent's fleet of ships before they sink yours.</p>

        <h2>Game Setup</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Each player has a 10x10 grid for their ships and a 10x10 grid to track their attacks.</li>
            <li>Players place their ships on their grid. Ships cannot overlap.</li>
            <li>The game consists of different ships: Carrier (5 squares), Battleship (4 squares), Cruiser (3 squares), Submarine (3 squares), and Destroyer (2 squares).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Players take turns calling out coordinates.</li>
            <li>If a ship occupies that coordinate, it's a hit; otherwise, it's a miss.</li>
            <li>Mark hits with "✔" and misses with "✖".</li>
            <li>When all parts of a ship are hit, that ship is sunk.</li>
            <li>The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
        <p>The game ends when one player's entire fleet has been sunk. The other player is declared the winner.</p>
